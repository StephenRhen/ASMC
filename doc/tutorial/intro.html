    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The state machine compiler processes an input file describing the state
      machine and produces a c++ class which impliments the state machine.
      The output is two files. A c++ header with a <bold>.h</bold> extention
      and a c++ code file with a <bold>.cpp</bold> extenstion. All keywords
      in the input file are proceeded by a %, such as %class. User supplied
      code is enclosed between %{ and %} and is copied to the output file
      verbatum. The input file is divided into three sections seperated by
      %%. A header section containing options, a rules section containing
      descriptions of the state transitions and an optional code section.
      If the code section is omitted the final %% seperator is not required.</p>

    <p>To create the state machine class file it is only necessary to run the
      compiler on the description file. By convention the state machine
      description files are given a .sm extension. The compiler takes an
      optional argument to produce additional trace output as the state
      machine description is parsed. This is mostly only useful as a developer
      tool to debug the compiler.</p>
