#Led 1

The first example is an extremly simple state machine with only two
states and a single event. Connect a push button switch between D2 of
the processor board and ground. When the button is pressed the on-board
LED will turn on. When it is pressed again the LED will turn off.

In the state diagram the states are represented as circles and the
transitions are arrows connecting the circles. By convention state
name are given in lower case and events are all upper case. The code
given after the event name is executed when ever the state
transition is made.

The header portion of the description file specifies code to be
included at the top of the output .h file along with options defining
the state machine

    %{
    #include <Arduino.h>;
    %}

    %event BUTTON_PRESSED
    %state led_on led_off
    %class Led1Sm
    %start led_off
    
The code block at the start of the header section should be the first
thing in the section. This block is copied verbatum to the begining of
the output .h file. In the example we are including Arduino.h for the
definition of the digitalWrite() function. The option %event is required
and list all of the events. Multiple %event options can be specified
adding additional events. The %state option is also required listing
all of the states. Like the %event option it can occure multiple times
in the header section. The %class option is optional and give the class
name for the generated class. The output header and code file name will
be generated by appending .h and .cpp to the class name. If the %class
option is omitted the class name will be the same as the input file name
with any file name extensions removed. The optional %start gives the
initial state for the state machine. If no start state is specified
the first state given in the rules section will be used as the start
    state.
    
The next section defines the state transitions and attaches user code
to the transitions.
